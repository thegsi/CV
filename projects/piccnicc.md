Piccnic is a food delivery app, the app was created as a two week MVP using react.js frontend framework. The app displays shopping basket functionality and a wide variety of forms that will be similar to Unitie. Piccnic is a mobile first responsive web app. The app was designed to show to possible investors and although it looks and feels like the finished product there is no backend functionality as that will be added in a future sprint.
